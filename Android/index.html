        If you are not redirected automatically, follow the <a href='http://yttrium-tyclief.github.io/guides/Android/'>link to its new location</a>.

        Explanation: I renamed the repo and you may have this old repo bookmarked or it may be referenced in search engines. The guide is still active, I simply renamed the repo to better reflect the other guides I'll be uploading.
